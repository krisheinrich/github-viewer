# github-viewer

This SPA allows you to explore publicly avaliable GitHub repositories. Just search for a GitHub user to see some basic personal information (like name, location, and company) and browse their public repositories. Click on a repository title to view more information like the number of forks and a list of contributers.

This app was built using AngularJS and ngRoute for page routing. You can view a working demo of the app <a href="https://krisheinrich.github.io/github-viewer/#/main">here</a>.
